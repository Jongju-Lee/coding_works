              As we all know, it’s easy for marketers to brag about how great
              their product or service is. Writing compelling copy, shooting
              enticing photos, or even producing glamorous videos are all
              tactics we use to draw attention to our brands. While all of these
              strategies can be successful, there really is no better way to
              gain trust and prove the validity of your brand like customer
              testimonials.

              ZenDesk’s testimonial page is beautifully laid out AND functional,
              with a silent customer video playing on loop to serve as the
              banner, a menu to filter testimonials by location, company size,
              industry, and use case, and lastly thumbnails linking to the full
              customer stories for a variety of big-name brands. This is a clean
              and concise way to showcase their happy customers.
